# HeartStrokepredML
This project aims to develop a predictive model for stroke risk using a healthcare dataset. The project utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically bagging ensemble methods like BaggingClassifier with various base estimators (Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest), to build a robust and accurate model.
